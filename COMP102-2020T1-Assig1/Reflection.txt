Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

Almost certainly, when you wrote your code, you had bugs in it which you had to
fix. Some of the bugs were probably easy to identify; others probably took more
time.

1. Characterise the kinds of bugs you had to deal with (eg spelling, punctuation, ...)
No bugs

2. What techniques for fixing the bugs were most effective for you? Can you
think of better approaches that you could use next time?
