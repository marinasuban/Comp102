Understanding Java Questions: 
=============================

1. When do we use this to call a method and when do we use UI to call a method?
UI is used to call a method which already exists within the datafile e.g in UI.println(); println is a method which already exists and is not created by the user
this is used to call methods created by the user e.g this.drawMe would call the method called drawMe which the user created > public void drawMe(double left, double right) 

2. We have learned many different data types and they can be categorised into
two groups: primitives and Objects. List the primitive data types and some
examples of the Object data types we have learned so far. 
Primitive data types: boolean , byte , char , short , int , long , float and double
e.g
-Int is used to set the values of variables to integers(whole numbers without decimals), int num=7; 
-Double is used to set the values of variables to real numbers(numbers with decimals), double num=7.35;

Object data types: arrays, strings, classes, interfaces
e.g
Strings can be used to store a range of values/information - most often words, String greet=“Hello”;
