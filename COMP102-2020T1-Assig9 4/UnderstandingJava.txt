Understanding Java Questions: 
=============================


1. Explain why "off-by-one" errors are so easy to make when programming with
arrays.
Arrays start at an index of 0, therefore when using array.length in a for loop we must account for where our index has started when initiating it by using a i<array.length instead of a i<=array.length
example
int[] dim=new int{20,45,8};
When using:
for (int I=0; I<array.length; I++)
Int i will follow our index from 0 to 2
However when using:
for (int I=0; I<=array.length; I++)
Int i will start at 0 and end at 3 whereas our index starts at 0 and ends at 2 <- this is beyond our index and is called an off by one error

2. List three similarities and three differences between arrays and ArrayLists.
Differences:
-Arrays are static in size (you cannot change the length after creating the array object) whereas Arraylist have the ability to change in size (can remove/add elements in an array)
-Arraylist cannot contain primitive data type - only objects whereas arrays can contain both primitive data types and objects
-You have to know the length of your array when creating it whereas you do not need to know the length of your arraylist when creating it 

Similarities:
-both use index to refer and retrieve its elements
-both index start at 0
-both have null values
-both are used for methods relating to a list of elements

3. Complete the following method that will reverse the order of items
in an array of Card objects

     public void reverseItems(Card[] cardArray){
	for (int i=0 i<cardArray.length/2; i++){
	Card temp=cardArray[i];
	cardArray[I]=cardArray[cardArray.length-i-1];
	cardArray[cardArray.length-i-1]=temp;
	}
     }
