Understanding Java Questions: 
=============================

1. What are the general rules for defining a field or a method private or
public? When do we define something public static final?
The general rule for defining a field/method private or public is the accessibility requirement of the field/method.
A field/method is defined as private if it only needs to be accessed within one class whereas a field/method is defined as public if it needs to be accessed by all classes.

A public static final is used to defined constant variables which can be accessed by any class.
 
2. In your own words, explain what an object is and what a class is. Give
examples to explain when you need to create an object. 
A class has the capacity to call methods, declare variables, create objects (Specifies the set of actions this kind of object can perform/information the objects can hold). It is the top level component of a program - Everything executed in java is contained in a class.
e.g
	 public void animate(){
         Animal D1 = new Animal("dog","davey",50,100);
         D1.goRight(150);}

A object is an instance of a class, it stores/allocates memory and helps determine the behaviour of the class
e.g
	Animal D1 = new Animal("dog","davey",50,100);
