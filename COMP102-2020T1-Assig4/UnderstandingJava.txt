Questions for UnderstandingJava: 
================================ 


1. What is a variable? Give an example.
A variable is a placeholder which holds a value or word under a specific name - used when you want the computer to remember something temporary
E.g
Double age=19; means that the value of 19 is represented by the word age - the variable double indicates that the value held by the variable age is a number 

2. What is a literal string? Give an example.
A literal string is the specific value given to a String - which can be found incased in “” in a String
For example String str=“Hello”;, “Hello” is the literal string as it is the value of the variable string

3. Describe the differences between a variable and a literal string?  
Variables are the way a program stores values using symbolic names for example in String str=“Hello”; str is the variable
whereas a literal string is the value that is placed inside the variable for example in String str=“Hello”; “Hello” is the literal string

4. Defining and calling methods: What is an argument? What is a parameter? What does it mean when we say "arguments and parameters must match"?
Parameters are variables defined in a function definition for example public void drawHouse(double left,double top,double width,double height), left, top, width, height is the parameter of the function

Arguments are literal values or expressions passed to the function e.g in drawHouse(10,20,30,40); 10,20,30,40 is the argument

arguments and parameters must match means that the argument value passed into a function must be the same type as the variable type outlined by the parameter in the function
e.g 
Public void number(Double num){
UI.println(“this is your number”+num);
}

If you entered
number(hello);
This would return an error as the argument passed into the function is not the same type as the parameter (string (word) instead of double (number))
